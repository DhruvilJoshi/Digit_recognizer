# Digit_recognizer

•	Preprocessing dataset:
The data has 280 images divided in 10 folders 0-9. Those are also its classes. I resize those images to (28,28), also convert it to grayscale and store it as a list. I also scale pixel intensities to the range [0, 1]. The dataset is divided into 80% for training and the remaining 20% for testing.

•	Model training:
I use a LeNet model structure. It is a convolutional neural network structure proposed by Yann LeCun et al. in 1989. It is very simple and for our dataset seem to be good enough. It has 2 Convolution layers, 1 Fully connected layer and 1 Softmax classifier. I calculate loss using categorical_crossentropy and I use a adam optimizer. I train the network for 25 epochs as it starts to overfit if I continue.

•	Results:
The training loss and accuracy has been plotted as you see below. The loss at final epoch is of 0.4040, the accuracy is at 0.8884, the validation loss is of 0.9569 and the validation accuracy is at 0.7. Further I could train on MNIST or similar dataset and test it on our dataset.
